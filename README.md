Trying out [md2googleslides](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/md2googleslides)

```
npm install -g md2gslides
```

`cd` to a folder containing a .md file like [slides.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hchiam/trying-md2googleslides/master/slides.md)

```
md2gslides slides.md
```

(The first time you use it, you'll need to give it authorization and copy a code.)

You'll get Google slides generated for you, like this:
